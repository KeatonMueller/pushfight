# pushfight

This is my Senior Project for my Computer Science degree at Yale University.

It involves creating an intelligent agent for the game of Push Fight,
a multi-action adversarial board game.

Currently you are able to play against another human, a random agent, or
an agent employing the Minimax algorithm with Alpha Beta Pruning.

Future planned work includes adding an agent that performs Monte Carlo
Tree Search, as well as an agent using Online Evolutionary Planning.

It is coded using Java version 11.

## How to use it

This project requires you have the Java SDK installed. It was coded using Java 11, but other versions may work as well.

To run the program, navigate to the `src` directory and run `make gui` if you want to run the program with graphics.
Otherwise, run `make text`.
